Insta insure is an idea that digitizes health insurance information into a QR code, so that patients can have their details easily accessible during the hour of need. To have your health insurance details checked in, is the first step in receiving medical treatment, so insta insure makes sure that this process is faster and less painful.

The patient folder is a Django app that generates the QR code embedded with all the necessary health insurance details.
